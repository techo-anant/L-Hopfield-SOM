# Unofficial Implementation of "Networks of Neural Networks: More Is Different"

This repository contains an **unofficial** implementation of the paper **["Networks of Neural Networks: More Is Different"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16789)** by **Elena Agliari, Andrea Alessandrelli, Adriano Barra, Martino Salomone Centonze, and Federico Ricci-Tersenghi**.

## Overview

The paper explores how **multiple interacting Hopfield networks** can exhibit emergent capabilities beyond those of individual networks, particularly focusing on **pattern disentanglement**â€”the ability to separate composite inputs into their original components.

This repository provides an implementation of the procedure described in the paper, allowing users to experiment with and reproduce key findings.
